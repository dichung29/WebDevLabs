    <h2 id="greeting">Hi, my name is David</h2>

    <p id="intro">My name is David Chung, and I am a first-year student studying Information Systems with plans
        to add an additional major in Artificial Intelligence. I grew up in South Korea until the age of 3,
        where I moved from Southern California to Hawaii then Beijing, before settling in Southern
        California. I enjoy a combination of both business leadership as well as computer science,
        which is why I plan to pursue both Information Systems and Artificial Intelligence. My career
        goal after graduation is to develop my technical skills in computer science as a SWE engineer,
        then moving on to project management for tech companies. On the side, I hope to also work
        with nonprofit organizations that aim to further access to education. Growing up in multiple
        different environments, I have first-handedly seen the need for more accessible education.
        Outside of my professional life, I spend most of my free time learning new songs and jamming
        with friends. I also love skiing, and over this past season have started getting into park skiing.</p>
